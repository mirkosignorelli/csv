This repository comprises 3 subfolders:

- `functions` contains functions for the computation of the one-tailed implementation of NEAT (originally implemented as a two-tailed test) and of the Community Structure Validation indices; moreover, it includes functions to simulate from the degree-corrected stochastic blockmodel for edge-valued graphs proposed in Section 4.1, as well as some further functions that are used in the simulations and data analyses;

- `simulations` contains the code used for the simulations in Sections 4.2-4.4 of the manuscript;

- `applications` contains the code used for the two example applications presented in Section 5.
