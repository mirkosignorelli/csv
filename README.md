# Community structure validation

Data and code to reproduce the simulations and data analysis presented in:

Signorelli, M., Cutillo, L. (in review). On community structure validation in real networks. ArXiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06611

This repository comprises 3 subfolders:

- functions contains functions for the computation of the one-tailed implementation of NEAT (originally implemented as a two-tailed test) and of the Community Structure Validation indices; moreover, it includes functions to simulate from the degree-corrected stochastic blockmodel for edge-valued graphs proposed in Section 2, as well as some further functions that are used in the simulations and data analyses;

- simulations contains the code used for the simulations in Section 4 of the manuscript;

- applications contains the code used in the example applications presented in Section 5.
